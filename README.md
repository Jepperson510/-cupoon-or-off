Potential Business Insights
Target solo commuters and young professionals 
They’re more frequent bar-goers.
They’re less likely to have kid passengers
Filtering out drivers with “Kid(s)” as passengers often produced higher acceptance rates, implying that bar coupons may appeal more to adults traveling without children.
Promotions should focus on individuals who frequently stop for coffee before/during work.
Less focus on family-oriented promotions 
Since acceptance rates are lower among drivers with kids, targeting parents might not be the best strategy.
Ads could be optimized for millennials and Gen Z, who are more likely to accept coffee house coupons.
